# PeriodicTable
Messing with famo.us from last summer. Trying to mimic their periodic table demonstration along with other view experiments

## Description

![Alt text](https://github.com/hunterrobbert/PeriodicTable/blob/master/preview.png "PeriodicTable screenshot")

There are a few different views. The one being added at the moment is called 'TestView' and is the PeriodicTable. 
There are other views, which were also just a few experiments.  They can be swaped in inside main.js by instantiating an new 
instance of one and changing 

mainContext.add(testView); 

to:

mainContext.add(whicheverViewYouWant);
